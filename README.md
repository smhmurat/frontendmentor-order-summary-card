### Overview
My first work on Frontend Mentor was very useful for me, especially in terms of using CSS and naming class selectors.

### What I learned

In this study, I learned how a card design should be in the center of the screen, especially according to the screen size used. I have experienced how to place sub-elements and use basic HTML and CSS.

Especially in CSS, the display issue was one of the most difficult topics for me.

```css
.card-body-plan {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    background-color: #f8f9fe;
    margin: 1.5rem;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 25px;
}
```

### Continued Development

Display, grid, flexbox and responsive design topics will be the topics that I have the most difficulty at this stage and that I will focus on in the projects I will do in the future.
